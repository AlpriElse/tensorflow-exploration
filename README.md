- Implement sqrt.py (Square Root Estimator)

## Comments
Measured by lines of code, tensorflow-exploration appears easily implementable; but, what was not reflected in code, was the time spent understanding the linear algebra and the conceptualization behind Machine Learning. Most of this project was just learning how ML works and how to use the Tensorflow library. Earlier in this project, we set out to do a facial recognition project, however, with our limited experience with Linear Algebra and ML, we decided to use to ML as a learning exploration into ML with trivial use cases.
